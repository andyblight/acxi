acxi is a simple tool that syncs/converts lossless (flac, wav, raw) 
music libraries to compressed (ogg,mp3) versions of the lossless 
library.

The general idea is that you can use the compressed version of your
lossless music files on your portable devices.

acxi doesn't change very often, and in general will 'just work' for 
as long as it's installed, though it is a good idea to check for 
updates now and then. It is used to process the lossless files 
generated by programs like abcde, the audio cd ripping tool, and makes
for very easy updating of all your music files.

It also copies over all associated data, like .txt, .jpg, .tiff, and 
so on, files, so you have a full copy of your originals in compressed 
format. It allows setting all variables, like compression rates, target 
and source directories, and and so on. You can add or remove these
file types using either top configuration, configuration file, or 
program option (-c).

acxi supports configuration files at either /etc/acxi.conf, or user
override files $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/acxi.conf, $HOME/.acxi.conf, or 
$HOME/.config/acxi.conf. The user configuration values override any
/etc/acxi.conf values.

See the top of acxi, or the man page, for instructions on how to 
create the configuration items.

You must at a minimum set your source and destination directories the
first time you run acxi.
