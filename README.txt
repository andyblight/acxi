acxi is a simple tool that converts music libraries to compressed versions of that library.

The general idea is that you will synch your main non compressed lossless libraries to compressed versions, that you can use on your portable devices to save space etc.

acxi is stable and is used as a next step to things like abcde, the audio cd ripping tool, and makes for very easy updating of all your music files.

Also copies over all associated data, like .txt, .jpg, .tiff, and so on, files, so you have a full copy of your originals in compressed format. Allows setting all variables, like compression rates, target and source directories, and and so on.
