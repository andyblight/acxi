README for acxi - a comand line audio file conversion tool

The 3.0 release (2018-12-07, long delayed) features improved error
handling, extra --test option to test your configurations before
actually running the sync live, improved output formatting, the 
ability to have your target (compressed, lossy) directory inside 
your source directory, and modernized Perl 5. The Perl runs with
warnings/strict mode enabled as well. For the first time ever, a 
man page is included. Some tagging bugs were also fixed for mp3
generation. 

========================================================================
ABOUT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
acxi is a simple tool that syncs/converts lossless (flac, wav, raw) 
music libraries to compressed (ogg,mp3) versions of the lossless 
library.

The general idea is that you can use the compressed version of your
lossless music files on your portable devices.

acxi doesn't change very often, and in general will 'just work' for 
as long as it's installed, though it is a good idea to check for 
updates now and then. It is used to process the lossless files 
generated by programs like abcde, the audio cd ripping tool, and makes
for very easy updating of all your music files.

It also copies over all associated data, like .txt, .jpg, .tiff, and 
so on, files, so you have a full copy of your originals in compressed 
format. It allows setting all variables, like compression rates, target 
and source directories, and and so on. You can add or remove these
file types using either top configuration, configuration file, or 
program option (-c).

========================================================================
DEPENDENCIES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For backward compatibility, acxi requires only Perl 5.010 (or newer), 
so it should run on anything. Several features (copy, make directory, 
find files) were moved from *nix commands to Perl native commands.

Ogg encoding requires oggenc (Debian/Ubuntu package: vorbis-tools).
MP3 encoding requires: lame and flac (if source file is a flac).

In theory, acxi 3.x should run on Windows and Macs, but I have not
tested that, but as long as the source/destination directory paths and
the application paths are correct, it should 'just work'.

========================================================================
CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
acxi supports configuration files at either /etc/acxi.conf, or user
override files $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/acxi.conf, $HOME/.acxi.conf, or 
$HOME/.config/acxi.conf. The user configuration values override any
/etc/acxi.conf values.

If your system does not have the $HOME or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME environmental
variables (Windows, for example), you can use the manual config file
path option
$CONFIGURATION_DIRECTORY='';
to create a path to your acxi.conf configuration file.

See the top of acxi, or the man page, for instructions on how to 
create the configuration items.

You must at a minimum set your source and destination directories the
first time you run acxi, either using the -o and -s options, or in 
the USER VARIABLES section on the top of the file, or in a 
configuration file.

acxi defaults to using ogg level 7 for output, and flac for input,
and copies most common file types (which can be changed with -c or
configuration values).
