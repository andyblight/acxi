.SH NAME
acxi  \- Command line audio conversion tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBacxi\fR

\fBacxi\fR [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBacxi\fR is a command line audio conversion program. It converts and syncs
all desired source lossless files to a lossy directory location. Supports 
lossless formats flac/wav/raw. Output formats are ogg or mp3.

By default, it will also copy over most common filetypes like gif, jpg, png, 
txt, pdf, doc, docx, and a few others. You can change the defaults using 
a configuration file.

The destination directory cannot be the same as the source directory, but
it can be inside of the source directory.

.SH USING OPTIONS
Options can be combined if they do not conflict. You can either group the letters
together or separate them.

For example:
.B acxi
\fB\-o mp3\fR or \fBacxi \-o mp3\fR or \fBacxi \-d /home/you/music\fR

Note that some short form options have long form equivalents, which are
listed below. However, usually the short form is used in examples in order to
keep things simple.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c\fR,\fB \-\-copy\fR
Comma separated list of extensions for file types you want to sync to your
lossy music directory. Overrides default values. Use lowercase, but it's
case insensitive internally. Do not include the period in the extension.

Default values are: bmp doc docx gif jpg jpeg odt pdf png tif txt

If you use no value, it will not copy anything.

Sample: \fB\-c txt,pdf,png,jpg,jpeg,gif\fR

.TP
.B \-\-debug\fR
Full screen output, including full verbosity of 
flac/oggenc/lameconversion process for MP3 or OGG output.

.TP
.B \-\-default\fR
Single line per operation screen output, default value for acxi.

.TP
.B \-d\fR,\fB \-\-destination\fR
Full path to the directory where you want the processed lossy
(eg, ogg) files to go.

.TP
.B \-f\fR,\fB \-\-force\fR
Overwrites all the mp3/ogg/jpg/txt etc. files, even if they already 
exist. This is useful if you for example want to change compression
quality on existing files.

.TP
.B \-h\fR,\fB \-\-help\fR
This help menu.

.TP
.B \-i\fR,\fB \-\-input\fR
Input type. Supported types: flac, wav, raw. mp3 only supports flac input.

.TP
.B \-o\fR,\fB \-\-output\fR
Output type. Supported types: ogg, mp3

.TP
.B \-q [number]\fR,\fB \-\-quality [number]\fR
For ogg: n can be 1\-10. 10 is the largest file/highest quality.
For mp3: n can be 0\-9 (variable bit rate), 0 is largest file/
highest quality.

Note that using a higher or lower quality than you used to create
the compressed files will not result in redoing those files unless 
you use the \fB\-f\fR / \fB\-\-force\fR option to force the overwrite 
of the existing files.

.TP
.B \-\-quiet\fR,\fB \-\-silent\fR
Turns off all screen output, except for error messages.

.TP
.B \-s\fR,\fB \-\-source\fR
Path to the top-most directory containing your source files (eg, flac).

.TP
.B \-\-test\fR
Test your configurations without actually doing the copy and sync 
operations. Activates \fB \-\-debug\fR as well for more complete output.
                  
.TP
.B \-\-verbose\fR
Without full verbosity of debug, no flac/oggenc/lame for MP3
or OGG conversion process screen output, but more verbose than
default.

.TP
.B \-v\fR,\fB \-\-version\fR
Show acxi version.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
acxi will read its configuration/initialization files in the
following order:

\fB/etc/acxi.conf\fR contains the default configurations. These can be overridden
by user configurations found in one of the following locations. If 
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/acxi.conf\fR exists, it use it, else if
\fB$HOME/.conf/acxi.conf\fR exists, it will use it, and as a last default,
the legacy location \fB$HOME/.acxi.conf\fR is used, i.e.:

\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/acxi.conf\fR > \fB$HOME/.conf/acxi.conf\fR >
\fB$HOME/.acxi.conf\fR

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

The following corresponds to the \fBBEGIN USER MODIFIABLE VALUES\fR section
in the top comment header of acxi.

.TP
.B APPLICATION PATHS

The following set your system path for the required applications:

\fBCOMMAND_OGG\fR Sample: \fBCOMMAND_OGG=/usr/bin/oggenc\fR (default path)

\fBCOMMAND_FLAC\fR Sample: \fBCOMMAND_FLAC=/usr/bin/flac\fR (default path)

\fBCOMMAND_LAME\fR Sample: \fBCOMMAND_LAME=/usr/bin/lame\fR (default path)

\fBCOMMAND_METAFLAC\fR Sample: \fBCOMMAND_METAFLAC=/usr/bin/metaflac\fR (default path)
Metaflac is required ONLY for flac to mp3, to copy over the ID3 tags
If you are not going to make MP3s, only OGG files for output, you do 
not need this

.TP
.B SOURCE/DESTINATION/CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES

NOTE: DESTINATION_DIRECTORY cannot be the same as SOURCE_DIRECTORY.

\fBSOURCE_DIRECTORY\fR Sample: \fBSOURCE_DIRECTORY=/home/fred/music\fR 
This the original, working, like flac, wav, etc.

\fBDESTINATION_DIRECTORY\fR Sample: \fBDESTINATION_DIRECTORY=/home/fred/music/ogg\fR
This is the processed compressed music files, ie, ogg, mp3. Destination cannot 
be the same as Source directory, although it can be inside of the source directory.

NOTE: only use this if you are running Windows, or any OS without $HOME
or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME environmental variables. acxi will look for file:
acxi.conf inside that directory. You can see by running \fB\-h\fR
which will show paths being used to locate configuration files. 
CONFIG_DIRECTORY=/path/to/configuration/directory

.TP
.B INPUT/OUTPUT

The following are NOT case sensitive,ie flac/FLAC, txt/TXT will be 
found. INPUT_TYPE and OUTPUT_TYPE will be forced to lower case 
internally.

Changing quality levels will not redo existing files.

\fBINPUT_TYPE\fR Sample: \fBINPUT_TYPE=flac\fR 

\fBOUTPUT_TYPE\fR Sample: \fBOUTPUT_TYPE=mp3\fR 

\fBCOPY_TYPES\fR Sample: \fBCOPY_TYPES=doc,docx,bmp,jpg,jpeg\fR Use this
to override the default file types acxi will sync. Set to 'none', 
if you only want to sync the music files, not copy over images, text files,
etc.

\fBQUALITY_MP3\fR Sample: \fBINPUT_MP3=2\fR Supported values: 0-9. 0 is 
the largest file size / highest quality.

\fBQUALITY_OGG\fR Sample: \fBINPUT_OGG=8\fR Supported values: 1-10. 10 is 
the largest file size / highest quality.

.TP
.B DEBUG OUTPUT
\fBLOG_LEVEL\fR Sample: \fBLOG_LEVEL=3\fR You can turn these to always on either
here or in config file by setting to desired verbosity level here directly,
or in the configuration file. 

0 \- quiet/silent \- no output at all (except for errors).

1 \- default \- single line per operation. This is the default, so you don't need 
to change it.
    
2 \- verbose \- but without the actual conversion data from codecs

3 \- debug \-  all available information.
